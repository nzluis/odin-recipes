    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating.
        The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture.
        Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Stir together cream of chicken soup, cottage cheese,
            sour cream, cream cheese, Creole seasoning, onion powder,
             and 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder in a medium bowl
              until well blended and smooth. Fold in chicken, chopped
              onion, and parsley until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Stir together crackers, melted butter, and remaining 1/2
             teaspoon garlic powder in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Spoon chicken mixture evenly into an 11x7-inch or 9-inch
             square baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella then
              cracker mixture.</li>
        <li>Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the
             preheated oven until crackers are golden brown and edges
              are bubbly, about 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before
               serving; garnish with scallions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
